# Stroke.io

Stroke.io, or "Get The Money," is a program intended to help stroke-victims develop their motor and perception skills by presenting them randomly placed 
bills that they have to click on. They have to click on as many bills as possible for a limited amount of time. A higher dollar value recorded at the end 
of the program signifies better performance on the game and greater progress in their post-stroke recovery.
